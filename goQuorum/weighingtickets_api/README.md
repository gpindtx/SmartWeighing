# Weighing Tickets API

This service is a REST API that exposes a handful of routes that allow the communication with the Blockchain Network
that holds the smart contracts that control the lifecycle of the assets in question, the Weighing Tickets.

It exposes a simpler and more concise interface to abstract the complexity of operating directly with the smart contract,
by allowing the following operations through REST-based routes:

- The registration of a Weighing Ticket of a client.
- The query of all the tickets of a client.
- The query of a specific ticket of a client.
- The query of tickets of a client based on provided filters.
- The update of a ticket of a client. [The necessity of this route is still being studied].
- The removal of a ticket of a client [The necessity of this route is still being studied].
